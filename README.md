# Show in file browser

A plugin for Protégé 5.5.0 and onwards that adds a new action "Show in file browser" to Protégé's File menu.

Clicking on it reveals the currently active ontology in the operating system's file browser if the ontology was loaded from the local file system.

## Installation

Copy the jar file to your Protégé plugin folder (`<protege install path>/Java/plugins` or under macOS `<protege application bundle path>/Contents/Java/plugins`) and (re-)start Protégé.
